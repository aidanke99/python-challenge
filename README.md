Instructions:
In this challenge we looked at two datasets. One showed the profit/loss movement of a trader over an 86 month period, where our task is to find the overall movement of the investments, the average movement from month to month, the best profit month, and the worst loss month. Using python, and basic math, we will write formulas to calculate and extract the values from this csv file

In the seconf challenge, our task is to pull from a much larger csv file, and use python to write formulas tallying the total votes casted in a rural election, how many of those votes were for each of the three candidates, and who won the the election with the greatest number of the total votes.

Usage:
The purpose of this project is to extract and clean data from a large dataset, and narrow all the information into specific things we are looking for. A lot of the time data is stored, and hard to look back on, especially when the data is taken from a large sample. Our task is to create formulas to pull from a large csv file, and find specific useful information to get useful results from this data
